//
//  AXFocus.swift
//  Daisy
//
//  What has keyboard focus right now, asked through Accessibility.
//
//  This exists because of one question the layout fixer cannot answer
//  any other way: is it safe to send backspaces? Letters typed into a
//  MESSAGE LIST are type-select, not text — and the backspaces that
//  would fix a word there delete mail instead. Same shape in Finder, in
//  Gmail's keyboard shortcuts, in any app where a bare letter is a
//  command. A fixer that can't tell the difference is a text shredder
//  with good intentions.
//
//  Everything here is best-effort by design. Apps vary wildly in what
//  they expose (Electron and web views worst of all), and every failure
//  returns "don't know" — which callers must treat as "don't touch".
//
//  One class of "don't know" is recoverable: Chromium-based apps have no
//  accessibility tree at all until a client asks for one. See
//  `requestAccessibilityTree(forProcessID:)` — callers that get nothing
//  useful should ask, then move on and expect an answer next time.
//
//  AX calls block on the target app, so the messaging timeout is pinned
//  short: this runs between a keystroke and the character appearing, and
//  an unresponsive app must cost us milliseconds, not seconds.
