//  "What did I miss?" — a summary of the last few minutes of a meeting
//  that is still being recorded. You step out for coffee, come back,
//  and get the thread instead of scrolling a live transcript.
//
//  Deliberately ephemeral. Nothing is written to the session: not to
//  transcript.md, not to summary.json, not to the sidecars. It is a
//  glance at the last five minutes, not a second summary competing
//  with the real one — and a user who asks three times in a meeting
//  should not find three artifacts in their folder afterwards.
//
//  The echo pass is not optional here. On speakers the mic re-captures
//  the other party, so the last five minutes contain every remote line
//  twice — once as them, once as the user. A catch-up built on that
//  tells the user what THEY supposedly said while they were out of the
//  room, which is worse than no catch-up at all.
