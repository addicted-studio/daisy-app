//
//  Single source of truth for "how much room is left, and does Daisy
//  still record audio?". Three surfaces need the same answer and used
//  to each carry their own copy of the arithmetic:
//
//    • RecordingSession — decides at start() whether this session goes
//      transcript-only, and re-checks mid-recording.
//    • HomeView — the low-disk row on the onboarding card.
//    • LogReporter — the `Disk:` line in a support report.
//
//  They MUST agree. A warning on Home that says "audio is fine" while
//  the recorder has already dropped to transcript-only is worse than no
//  warning at all, and that's exactly what three separate thresholds
//  drift into.
//
//  Everything here measures "important usage" capacity, which counts
//  purgeable space — so we don't cry low-disk over space macOS would
//  free on demand.
