//
//  EndOfDaySummaries.swift
//  Daisy
//
//  Runs the summarizer over the day's meetings, once a day, at an hour
//  the user picks.
//
//  "The day's meetings" is expressed as "recordings that still have no
//  summary", not as "recordings started today". Same set on any normal
//  evening — everything older already got one — but it self-heals:
//  a night the provider was down, an interrupted pass, and a meeting
//  recorded at 21:00 after the pass already ran are all picked up next
//  evening, with no bookkeeping about what was attempted when.
//
//  Why this exists: summarizing inline after Stop puts a heavy LLM pass
//  on the machine at the exact moment the user has finished the meeting
//  and wants the laptop back — and it lands there right after the final
//  Whisper pass, speaker matching and screen OCR have already run. With
//  a cloud provider nobody notices. With a local model that pile-up is
//  what "Daisy melts my Mac" means in practice (Ken, 2026-07-29). The
//  work still has to happen; it just doesn't have to happen THEN.
//
//  Deliberately a poll, not a scheduled timer. A `Timer` set for 20:00
//  does not fire while the Mac is asleep and does not exist while the
//  app is quit — the two states a laptop spends its evening in. Asking
//  "has today's slot passed, and have we run today?" every few minutes
//  answers correctly after a wake, after a relaunch, and after the
//  machine was shut at 19:00 and opened at 23:00. The persisted
//  last-run DAY is the whole state.
