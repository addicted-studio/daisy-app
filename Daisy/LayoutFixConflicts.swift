//
//  LayoutFixConflicts.swift
//  Daisy
//
//  Refuses to run the automatic layout fixer while ANOTHER layout
//  switcher is running.
//
//  Why this file exists. Two layout switchers on one keyboard is not
//  "both features work" — it is one word converted twice. Caramba (or
//  Punto) flips «ghbdtn» to «привет» as it is typed; our tap then sees a
//  word that is now perfectly good Russian and, on a bad day, judges it
//  the other way. The user gets garbage they never typed, from a feature
//  that is supposed to be conservative, and cannot tell which app did
//  it. Refusing is the only honest answer, and the person already has a
//  layout switcher they chose — theirs wins.
//
//  DETECTION IS DELIBERATELY NARROW. The generic way to find a rival is
//  `CGGetEventTapList`: every ACTIVE keyboard tap on the system, ours
//  included. But an active keyboard tap is also how text expanders,
//  launchers, and macro tools work — Raycast, Alfred, Keyboard Maestro,
//  TextExpander. Refusing on "somebody else taps the keyboard" would
//  turn the feature off for exactly the people who install this kind of
//  software, and they are our users. So the refusal list is the two
//  programs whose whole job is the same as this feature's, and the tap
//  list is only ever LOGGED — because "it does nothing" was the entire
//  content of the first bug report about this feature, and a rival tap
//  is a plausible cause that is otherwise invisible from a log.
//
//  Adding to the list is cheap; guessing is not. An app that gets this
//  wrong disables a feature the user turned on, silently. Every entry
//  here is a program that auto-converts mistyped words, verified by
//  bundle identifier.
