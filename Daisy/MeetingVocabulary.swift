//  MeetingVocabulary.swift
//  Daisy
//
//  The user's vocabulary, applied to meetings.
//
//  Dictation has had this since 1.0.5: their own replacement rules
//  ("клод" → "Claude") plus the built-in transliterated-brand table
//  ("фигма" → Figma) run over the text before it is pasted. Meetings
//  got neither, so the same word came out right when dictated and
//  wrong when recorded — the single most reported inconsistency in the
//  vocabulary feature.
//
//  Three layers now cover a meeting, weakest evidence last:
//
//    1. Decoder bias — the vocabulary is fed to Whisper's prompt on the
//       final pass, so it is more likely to hear the term correctly in
//       the first place (`WhisperEngine`, wired from `finalizePostStop`).
//    2. This module — deterministic text replacement over the finished
//       segments. Exact, auditable, and the only route that works for
//       Parakeet, which has no prompt support at all.
//    3. `TranscriptPolisher` — the LLM pass, which catches what neither
//       rule nor bias did.
//
//  Layer 2 runs on segment TEXT only, one segment at a time. It cannot
//  merge, split, drop or reorder anything, which is what makes it safe
//  to run unattended over a transcript nobody is going to re-read.
