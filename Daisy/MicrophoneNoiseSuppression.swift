//  MicrophoneNoiseSuppression.swift
//  Daisy
//
//  A deliberately conservative, dependency-free microphone noise gate.
//  It attenuates low, steady room noise while leaving normal speech at
//  unity gain. The setting is opt-in because any gate can soften very
//  quiet speech. Processing happens on CoreAudioMicRecorder's serial
//  worker queue, never on the real-time render thread.
