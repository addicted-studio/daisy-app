//
//  PasteboardProxy.swift
//  Daisy
//
//  Borrowing the user's clipboard to read or replace a selection in
//  another app, and giving it back.
//
//  macOS has no API to read the selection of another application, so
//  every app that acts on "what I have selected" does the same dance:
//  snapshot the pasteboard, synthesize ⌘C, read, act, write, synthesize
//  ⌘V, put the snapshot back. The dance is the whole feature — get it
//  wrong and you have destroyed something the user copied ten minutes
//  ago and expected to still be there.
//
//  This lives in ONE place because Daisy now does it from two features
//  (rewrite-in-my-voice and the layout fixer) and two independent
//  restore timers racing over one pasteboard is a bug that only shows
//  up when someone uses both within a second and a half.
//
//  `Borrow` is deliberately a value the caller has to carry: it makes
//  "who owes the clipboard back" a thing the compiler helps with rather
//  than a comment.
