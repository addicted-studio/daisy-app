//  PreMeetingBrief.swift
//  Daisy
//
//  Local pre-meeting brief. Before a calendar meeting, Daisy assembles a
//  short "what you need in your head walking in" brief from the user's
//  OWN past recorded sessions with the same people — matched by attendee
//  email, linked calendar-event title, or meeting title. The dossier of
//  past notes is handed to the selected summary provider under the brief
//  prompt (`SummaryPrompt.briefContext`), reusing the entire provider +
//  decode pipeline and the `MeetingSummary` output type.
//
//  Privacy: fully local whenever the summary provider is local (Apple
//  Intelligence / Ollama / LM Studio). The optional online-research
//  augmentation (`AppSettings.preMeetingBriefResearchOnline`) is the only
//  path that touches the network, is off by default, and is a no-op
//  without an Anthropic API key. See `AttendeeWebResearch`.
