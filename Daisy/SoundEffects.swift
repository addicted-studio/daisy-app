//  Daisy
//
//  Tiny audio cues for recording lifecycle events. Uses macOS
//  built-in `NSSound`-named system sounds so we don't have to
//  bundle audio assets — every macOS install since 10.0 ships the
//  same set under `/System/Library/Sounds/`. Apple has used these
//  same names since the System 7 era; they're effectively part of
//  the platform's vocabulary.
//
//  Selection is mode-aware on start. `Tink` originally signalled
//  "armed" for meeting starts but reads as a system-edge ping in
//  macOS UX (volume max, end-of-slider, unhandled key), which
//  made every hotkey tap feel like a mis-press. Replaced with
//  `Purr` for both meeting + dictation — a short, warm
//  "listening" tone. Voice notes keep `Pop` so quick taps stay
//  audibly distinct from the longer recording modes; we'll align
//  on Purr there too if the difference doesn't earn its keep.
//
//  Selection (2026-05-31 — pared back after the 4-lens A/V review):
//   • Start (meeting)    → "Purr"   — short, warm, "listening"
//   • Start (voice note) → "Pop"    — soft accent, neutral
//   • Start (dictation)  → "Purr"   — same as meeting-start
//   • Finished           → "Glass"  — clear, complete; fired the instant
//                                     `.finished` lands so it syncs with the
//                                     widget's celebration pop
//   • Failed             → "Sosumi" — distinct, gentle "something's wrong"
//
//  Pause / Resume cues were REMOVED: they fired mid-capture (the worst
//  leak window — on built-in speakers the loopback records them, and on
//  macOS 26 self-exclusion is off), and the widget colour already carries
//  the state (gray ↔ orange). The old Stop-click cue was likewise dropped —
//  it fired BEFORE capture stopped (tailing the recording) and before any
//  work finished; the "done" signal now lives on `.finished`.
//  `playPause` / `playResume` / `playStop` are kept below, unused, for
//  reference / quick revert.
//
//  ⚠️ KNOWN GAPS (dev / design): the Start cue can still be captured on
//  macOS 26 until the SystemAudioCapture self-exclusion split is restored.
//  And these reused macOS system sounds are placeholders — a small bespoke
//  palette (bloom / settle / error, one instrument) is the real fix and
//  needs a sound designer + bundled assets. See the 2026-05-31 review note.
//
//  Volume: each NSSound starts at 1.0; we set 0.4 to keep cues
//  noticeable but not jarring. Recording-app sounds that boom
//  through office speakers are a usability hazard.
//
//  All entry points respect `AppSettings.recordingSoundsEnabled`
//  via the call sites in `RecordingSession`; this file just
//  plays — it doesn't gate.
