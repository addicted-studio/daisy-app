//
//  SpeakerNameMatching.swift
//  Daisy
//
//  Deciding whether two written forms of a name are the same person.
//  "Priya" and "Priya Raman"; "PriyaRaman" and "Priya Raman"; "AJ" and
//  "A J". Used wherever a name from one source has to be reconciled
//  with a name from another — a proposal against the calendar roster,
//  a calendar attendee against a saved speaker profile.
//
//  The rules are deliberately one-directional and deliberately timid,
//  because the two failure modes are not symmetric:
//
//    • Failing to merge costs the user one manual rename. Annoying.
//    • Merging wrongly puts a real person's name on someone else's
//      words, in a transcript that flows into the summary, the
//      follow-up draft, and anything auto-sent. That is not annoying,
//      it is a false record.
//
//  So: the fuller written form always wins, a short form never absorbs
//  a long one, spaceless forms only match when their parts are long
//  enough to not be initials, and ANY ambiguity resolves to "no match"
//  rather than to a best guess.
