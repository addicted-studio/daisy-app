//  Who is "Remote B"? Diarization can tell voices apart but cannot
//  name them; voice fingerprints only recognize people the user has
//  already named once. That leaves the common case unsolved — a first
//  meeting with three people from the invite, and a transcript full of
//  "спасибо, Прия" and "Alex, can you take that one?".
//
//  This pass reads the finished transcript alongside the invite's
//  attendee list and proposes label → name. It runs after
//  `TranscriptPolisher`, so the names in the text have already been
//  restored to their canonical spelling and match the invite.
//
//  **Nothing here is ever applied automatically.** Proposals go to the
//  `speaker_suggestions.json` sidecar, where the session's
//  Name-the-speakers card renders each one with a Confirm and a
//  Dismiss. That is a deliberate ceiling on the damage: a wrong name
//  in a transcript is worse than no name at all — it is a quotation
//  attributed to a real person who did not say it, and it propagates
//  into the summary, the follow-up draft, and anything auto-sent.
//  "Remote B" is honest; "Priya" might not be.
//
//  The guard that makes the proposals safe is an allow-list, not a
//  prompt: a suggestion survives only if it resolves to a name from
//  THIS meeting's invite. The model cannot introduce a name, and it
//  cannot move a name in from another meeting — the worst it can do is
//  propose the wrong one of the people who were actually there, which
//  the user then declines with one click.
