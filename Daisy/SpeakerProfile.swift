//  SpeakerProfile.swift
//  Daisy
//
//  One persistent voice profile — Daisy's record of "this 256-d
//  embedding vector belongs to a person the user has named". Saved
//  to disk in the app's container and matched against new sessions
//  so users name a speaker once and Daisy auto-labels them in every
//  future meeting.
//
//  Privacy: the embedding is a biometric derivative — irreversible
//  (you cannot reconstruct the voice from it) but uniquely
//  identifying. Lives in the sandboxed container, NEVER leaves the
//  Mac, can be wiped from Settings → Speakers → Forget all.

    // speaker DB on first launch after update. `decodeIfPresent` with

    // them non-optional in memory. The legacy six keys stay `decode`
    // (required) — any file that lacks THOSE was already unreadable
