//  SpectrumAnalyzer.swift
//  Daisy
//
//  Reduces a rolling window of mono PCM samples into 6 normalized
//  spectrum bands using a Hann-windowed 2048-point FFT (vDSP).
//
//  Tuned for the daisy widget — not scientific analysis:
//    • Voice-friendly Hz band edges (80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2560, 5120)
//    • RMS within each band (smoother than peak-pick)
//    • dB clamp (-55…-20) so conversation volume maps to 0…1 instead of
//      flat-lining near zero with linear scaling
//    • Asymmetric attack/decay smoothing for "petals bloom and settle"
//    • Per-band hysteresis noise gate (no chatter on speech tails)
//    • Pre-allocated working buffers (no allocations per call)
//    • Lock around mutable state — `reset()` is safe to call from any
//      thread while `bands(…)` is mid-flight on the audio render thread
