//
//  TranscriptTimecode.swift
//  Daisy
//
//  The `[mm:ss · Speaker]` stamp at the head of every transcript line,
//  treated as a coordinate rather than decoration.
//
//  It is the only per-line anchor the transcript has. The body is one
//  monolithic NSTextView — there are no row views to hang a control on —
//  so navigation between a moment in the conversation and the screenshot
//  taken around it has to go through the text itself: parse the stamp on
//  render, attach a `daisy-time://<seconds>` link to it, and read it back
//  from the attributed string when something needs to jump.
//
//  The stamps come from `MarkdownExporter`, which writes
//  `**[m:ss · Label]**` (hours appear only past the hour mark), so the
//  parser accepts both `m:ss` and `h:mm:ss`.
//
