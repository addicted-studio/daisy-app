//  Tiny shared helper for "what version is this app + put it on the
//  clipboard". Used by the click-to-copy affordance on the sidebar
//  version pill (MainView) and the About header version line
//  (AboutView). Pre-1.0.7.3 both sites had inlined identical copies
//  of the implementation; lifted out here so a future change (e.g.
//  add a debug-build flag to the copied string) lands once.
