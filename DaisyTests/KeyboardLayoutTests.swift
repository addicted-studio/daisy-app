//  Regression locks for the layout fixer's one pure, testable core:
//  `KeyboardLayout.converting(_:to:)`. Everything above it needs a real
//  keyboard, a real pasteboard or a real focused text field; this
//  function is characters in, characters out, and it is where both bugs
//  found in review actually live.
//
//  WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE, so nobody reads green as covered:
//  building layouts from a live `uchr` table (needs the machine's
//  installed layouts), `LayoutFix.automatic` (needs the system spell
//  checker and whichever dictionaries the user has), the ⌘C/⌘V round
//  trip, and the event tap. Those are the device-QA list, not unit tests.
